I use the preInstall function to verify the accessKey provided in the settings is valid. I specifically call the users endpoint
and have it return 1 GSID. The thought behind this is that there will always be at least 1 user in the Gainsight instance your
got the accessKey from because you need to log in to get the key. We don't care about the results we just care if the call failed.
If it fails we error out; if it doesn't then we proceed with the install.
